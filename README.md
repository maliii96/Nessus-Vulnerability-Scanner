# 🛡️ Nessus Vulnerability Scanning on Proxmox Lab

## Overview
This project showcases the use of Nessus for vulnerability scanning in a virtualized environment set up on Proxmox. The environment includes multiple VMs segmented into different VLANs using pfSense. A Metasploitable VM is used as the target for the scan, and Nessus is deployed on a Kali Linux VM to identify vulnerabilities.

## Project Setup

### 1. 🖥️ Proxmox Virtual Environment
- **Proxmox VE**: Hosted the virtual machines, providing an isolated environment for testing.
- **VMs**:
  - **Kali Linux**: Installed Nessus for scanning.
  - **Metasploitable**: Configured as a vulnerable target.

### 2. 🌐 VLAN Configuration
- **pfSense**: Managed network segmentation, ensuring that each VM was on a separate VLAN for controlled testing.
- **VLANs**: Configured to isolate the Metasploitable VM from other VMs, except for the Kali Linux VM, which was allowed to scan the target.

### 3. 🛠️ Nessus Installation and Configuration
- **Nessus**: Installed on Kali Linux, configured with default settings.
- **Scan Targets**: Set to the IP of the Metasploitable VM.

## Vulnerability Scanning

### 1. 🔍 Scanning Process
- Initiated a full system scan on the Metasploitable VM.
- Nessus performed vulnerability checks, identifying weaknesses and potential exploits.

## Scenario: Network Assessment for a Company

### 📂 Situation
In this scenario, I was tasked with scanning a company's internal network to identify potential security vulnerabilities. The network was segmented into multiple VLANs using pfSense, similar to the lab environment.

### 🔧 Approach
- **Initial Reconnaissance**: Deployed Nessus on a Kali Linux VM to scan the specified network segments.
- **Vulnerability Discovery**: Conducted a thorough scan to uncover misconfigurations, outdated software, and other security flaws.

### 📝 Deliverables
- **Comprehensive Report**: Provided the company with a detailed Nessus report that included a list of vulnerabilities, categorized by severity.
- **Recommendations**: Offered high-level guidance on addressing the critical issues, while the company’s IT team was responsible for implementing the specific remediation measures.

## Results and Analysis
- **Findings**: The scan revealed several high-severity vulnerabilities, typical of a Metasploitable environment.
- **Actionable Insights**: Recommendations included patching, configuration changes, and further isolation of critical systems.

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with using Nessus for vulnerability assessment in a controlled virtual environment. The segmentation of VMs via pfSense allowed for secure testing, and the generated reports offer valuable insights into improving security posture in a real-world scenario.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Proxmox VE**: Virtualization platform
- **pfSense**: Open-source firewall and router
- **Kali Linux**: Penetration testing distribution
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanning tool
- **Metasploitable**: Vulnerable target VM for testing

## Future Work
- 🚀 Explore more advanced configurations of Nessus.
- 🔄 Implement automated remediation based on Nessus findings.
- 🛠️ Expand the environment to include additional vulnerable systems for comprehensive testing.
